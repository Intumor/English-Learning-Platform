        <p>
          In this lesson we will talk about what's next and pick up a few other things. <br><br>
          First things first: Congratulations! You have made it! Learning a new language isn't easy but very rewarding once you get there. Now we can talk about things we like, thing we are interested in and importantly: enjoy doing it. Of course we only learned the basics and we still have a lot of room t improve but this was a very important stage of language aquisition. It may seem like it's all tangled up, but give it a little time to sit with you and it will make more sense over time
          <br><br>
          The next step should be emersion. Movies, TV shows, cartoons, books, all of this will let you be surrounded by English. Some even say they start seeing dreams in English.
          <br><br>
          All that sounds really nice, but as we were provn time and time again, we need the basics. Without the basics, the skeleton on which we put everything else we won't get far. At this point i don't i don't expect you to know the basics by heart and use them correctrly if someone woke you up at 2am, but you should be familiar with ut and be able to find your way around it. Maybe not everything works automatically but with exposure to the language it will come faster, and the more you are exposed to it the sooner all the basics will start working for you and you will even have to think about which form of the verb to use, it will just come out without you noticing. Instead you will focus on something more important: enjoying the conversation.
          <br><br>
          Throughout this course we were trying to aquire the most popular words, and from this point on you can either use the basics that we learned or expand your knowledge and build a bigger more impressive vocabulary, although big vocabulary isn't everything it helps a lot.
          <br><br>
          What do you associaate with English now? What comes to mind when you hear or see the word? Did it change? As i said before the reason i want you to have an association is because it helps you relax and also remember that English isn't just flat grammar, words, sctructures, but emtions, feelings, jokes and many more, there is the whole world out there ready for you to come see and interact with it, which i hope you will enjoy doing!

        <h2>Each other</h2>
        <div class="schoolboard">
          <div class="example-box">
            <p class="for-example">
              This one is quite straight forward. "Each other" means "el uno al otro" or "la una a la otra"
            </p>
          </div>
          <p class="example">
            They love each other - Ellos se aman el uno al otro <br>
            We see each other - Nosotros vemos el uno al otro <br>
            We need each other - Nosotros nesisitamost el uno al otro
        </div>

        <p class="new-words">
          trust - confiar<br>
          hug - abrazar<br>
          support - apoyar<br>
          respect - respetar<br>
          meet (met) [met] - reunir<br>
          greet - saludar
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="section-three">
        <h2>He is loved</h2>
        <p>
          Let's take a look at one more sctructure in English. We learned that there three forms of the irregular verb like "see (saw) [seen]" <br><br>
          So the word seen is a past participle, and we can use it in the way we use past participle in Spanish as well
        </p>

        <p class="example example-no-board">
          He loves - Él ama <br>
          He is loved - Él es amado <br>
          He sees - Él ve<br>
          He is seen - Él es visto
        </p>

        <p>
          As we can see the logic is similar, if the verb is regular we add "ed" if irregular we use the third form of that verb. Just like in the structure "i have seen/loved" <br><br>
          Let's take a look at some other examples:
        </p>

        <p class="new-words">
          build (built) [built] - construir
        </p>

        <p class="example example-no-board">
          The house was built - La casa fue construida <br>
          He built a house - Él construyó una casa <br>
          The house is being built - La casa está siendo construida<br>
          The house will be built - La casa será construida
        </p>

        <p class="new-words">
          do (did) [done] - hacer
        </p>

        <p class="example example-no-board">
          It was done - Estaba hecho <br>
          It will be done - Se hará
        </p>

        <p class="new-words">
          clean - limpiar <br>
          discuss - discutir
        </p>

        <p class="example example-no-board">
          The question will be discussed - La pregunta será discutida <br>
          The question was discussed yesterday - La pregunta fue discutida ayer
        </p>

        <p>
          And last but not least the verb "to be" is sligthly differeny but the past participle of "be" is "been"
        </p>

        <p class="example example-no-board">
          i have been to Spain three times - He estado en España tres veces <br>
          I have never been to Germany - Nunca he estado en Alemania
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't worry if you can't remember all the forms the irregular verbs right away, with time you will get them all. After all there are not so many of them. Ninety percent of all the verbs arer irregular only a small portion of them is irregular, they are however the most popular ones, which makes it easier to remember them since you will be encountering them all the time
        </p>

        <h2>Written by...</h2>
        <p>
          Before we jump into exercises there is one last thing i wanted to mention and it is simply the word "by". You would use to indicate that an action is done by someone. Maybe you've seen before in the credits to some movies or cartoons
        </p>
        <p class="example example-no-board">
          Written by John Smith - Escrito por John Smith<br>
          Music by Larry Durkis - Música por Larry Durki<br>
          It was done by me - Fue hecho por mí<br>
          Her was seen by you - Él fue visto por ti
        </p>
        <p class="new-words">
          found - fundar<br>
          publish - publicar<br>
          release - lanzar<br>
          script - guion<br>
          role - papel<br>
          buy (bought) [bought] - comprar <br>
          sell (sold) [sold] - vender

        <h2>What's next?</h2>
        <p>
          As you can see we can add more words to the sentence making it more complex, however the structure stays he same, that's why it's important to know it
          <br><br>
          In order ro retain all that we've learned here it is importantto associate everything you hear with somethingand try to visualize what you hear. When someone says "i will visit my grandma next year" you should the able to visualize someone visiting their grandma one year from now. That is the best way to rememberthe words, expression and so on. And remember word means something only in some context, don't try to memorize lists of words that is a very ineffective way to learn. They way you want to approach it is by consuming content you like. Any time you come across a new word, you translate it to your native language or you can even try to guess what it means first, that would teach your brain how to learn words from the context (you can ask ChatGPT for 5 sentences using that word and try to guess what it means from those examples), you will learn a lot of words this way as well, without having to look them up. And when you get the word you write it down, and try to use it in a sentence, or two. You don't have to write this sentence down, but it would be great if you could say it out loud. That way you will be involving your visual memory, motoric memory and your listening based memory. It will increase chances of you retaining this word. You don't have to go over the words or anything (although it is up to you, review words that you learned is also a great tool that i have used myself quite successfully), you just keep going forward, keep reading or watching and keep doing this, the point is that you will keep coming across all of those words and over time you will have memorized all of them without cramming or anything like that. You will forget some of them, it's impossible to memorize everything the first time you see it unless you have an extroadinary memory, but just rememeber that it's a natural part of learning. Sometimes you will have to come across the same word twenty times before it sticks with you, it's normal.
          <br><br>
          As for the content, you have a lot of sources on the internet. You can watch ted talks, read books, short stories, youtube videos and so on and so forth
          <br><br>
          Fluency doesn't come from knowing a lot of big words, it is the abilty to use what you have to express yourself. Of course you won't be able to express yourself well if you only know ten words, but you don't need to know thousands and thousands of words in order to be bale to speak and understand spoken English. Ninety percent of the lexicon of an average native speaker is made up by one-two thousand most popular words that they use to talk about almost anything. A 5 year-old doesn't know a lot of words but can talk about whatever he wants, unless it's quantom mechanics that is
          <br><br>
          The way you practice a language on your own is by watching movies, tv shows, youtube videos, really, anything you like. You can watch a movies in your native language first, or choose a movie that you have already seen in your native language and watch it English the second time around. In that case you already know the plot so you can just relax and enjoy it. You don't have to limit yourself with only that kind of movies or shows but it's a great place to start. I would recommend starting with TV shows where each episode is 20 minutes long. Something like "Hannah Montana", "Wizards of Waverly Place", "Lizzie McGuire", "Victorious", "Sabrina, the Teenage Witch". These are just a few. Think what you saw in the past that you liked and was originally in English and start with that.
          <br><br>
          The question that i get a lot is wheather or not it's a good idea to watch all of that with subtitles in English or in your native language. I always recommend not using any subtitles at all. You don't have subtitles in real life, first of all, and second of all, you will greatly improve your listenimg skills and intuitive understanding of the language this way. Let your brain convert the sounds that you hear into images, emotions or any kind of associations it will choose, that way you will be aquiring the language similarly to the way kids aquire their first language
          <br><br>
          being exposed to the language is really important! it's probably the best thing you can do. Input is invaluable. Many people try to learn a language just by speaking and translating but that will never work. If you are not familiar with the ways native speaker use the language you will not be able to use it like they do. That's why you should surround yourselfwith content. If you don't have a chance to speak English it's ok, but you should find a way to watch or listen to something in English, that's much more important. Of course eventually speaking will become more and more important as well as you improve
          <br><br>
          A lot of people make a mistake of watching news in English, but i wouldn't recommend doing that, unless you are a big news fan. On the news they try to give you a lot of precise information in a very cionsize form with no room for filler words and a normal, relaxed human language. instead you should opt for movies, TV shows, talk shows, youtube videos and so on
          <br><br>
          At first you might not understanda lot and it's ok. It's ok if you watch and episode of a TV show and don't understand almost anything, you will always have another one, and each time you will understand more and more. Getting new words and watching something everyday will eventually bring to a very high level, you get new words in one place and then hear in another, just trust the process and good things will happen.
          <br><br>
          As a way of practice speaking you can start writing a diary, it doesn't have to be much, just a few lines everyday will do. This will help to put everything you learned to practice
          <br><br>
          Of course we can keep learning and inprove but we will always be dependant on the basics. By making these basics work for use we will get this feeling if feeedom and ease when we speak English or listen to it. So i hope you will keep finding time to go over the structures until you're comfortable with them, in order not lose them and keep them with you forever
          <br><br>
          This concludes our final, sixteenth lesson. I wish you good luck and many great conversations. Wherever you go and whatever you do, I wish you the very best that a person can hope to achieve
          <br><br>
          Thank you very much!
