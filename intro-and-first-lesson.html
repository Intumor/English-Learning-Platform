        <p>
          Hello and welcome to Lingua Genius! I will be assisting you on your way to becoming a great English speaker.
          <br><br>
          Many people ask me how it's even possible to learn English from scratch in just 16 hours or 16 days. Sounds like some kind of wicked sorcery, right? But I always ask another question in return. How come most people spend years studying English in school and can't put together a basic sentence? The problem lies in a fundamental misconception of what it ACTUALLY takes to learn English. It's not hours of cramming grammar and memorizing lists of words. First of all, no adult in the world would actually do that, and second of all, it is simply not effective. Also, many people think that English is something that only a select few can master, which is also not true.
          <br><br>
          I'm here to show that anyone can learn how to speak English and get outstanding results in just 16 hours. In fact, I'll go even further and say that 3 weeks is enough to learn ANY language.
          <br><br>
          If you want to fully master the language and learn everything there is to know about it, a lifetime won't be enough.
          <br><br>
          If you want to be able to use the language professionally, it would also take a lot of work, effort, practice, and time.
          <br><br>
          But if you want to be able to understand and be understood, 16 lessons are enough to do exactly that.
          <br><br>
          Learning a language might seem like a ton of work, but if you think about it, it's really not the case. There are only 400 words that are constantly used in every conversation. About a hundred of them are verbs, 50-60 of which are irregular, about a hundred are nouns, about 60 are adjectives, and the rest are made up of prepositions, pronouns, articles, and so on. The learning curve isn't as steep as you might think. It is imperative to understand that you don't need to learn "all the words" to be able to speak; you just need the most popular ones.
          <br><br>
          A child starts talking not when he knows a lot of words, but when he learns how to use the ones that he has already. This is the process that we will aim to recreate.
          <br><br>
          I will ask you to do one thing. Again, I understand that no one (especially adults) is gonna spend hours doing homework; some might not have enough time or will to do that, but as I said, it's not even necessary. What is necessary, though, is to spend 10-15 minutes of your time going over the table that we will learn in this lesson. Probably, some of you will neglect it, but it is crucial if you want to succeed at this. I've been teaching English for several years, and I've heard all kinds of things; the most common one is "I don't have time." I can understand that you might not have a lot of time, but I'm 100% convinced that anyone has 5 minutes in the morning, lunchtime, and dinner to go over this table.
          <br><br>
          The bottom line is, if you want to actually get results, you will need to find these 10-15 minutes a day to review it. At least for the duration of this course 😜
          <br><br>
          I also suggest taking notes in your notebook. You can write down new words and essential grammar points. This will make it easier for you to retain all of this in your memory as you will not only be involving your visual memory but also motor memory.
          <br><br>
          This course is designed to take you to a level where you are comfortable, where you can speak and participate in conversations in 16 hours. I really recommend taking no more than one lesson a day. You can go slower if you want to, but I don't recommend going through it faster. It's better if you let the information sit with you for a little to let it sink in.
          <br><br>
          All that being said, without further ado, let's dive into it!

        <h2 class="lesson-header">Basic Verb Structure</h2>
        <p>Basic Verb Structure is the corner stone of English Language. This is one of the most important concepts that you will have to get familiar with. You will master half of the language by simply mastering this table.</p>

        <br><br>

        <p>There are three ways of making a sentence. You can make a positive statement, a negative statement and you can ask something. You can do that in three tenses: Future, Present and Past</p>

        <br><br>

        <p>
          I would strongly recommend copying this table down in your notebook. This way you will be able to go over it later on and it is also a great way to remember it faster 😁
        </p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Question</th>
              <th>Positive</th>
              <th>Negative</th>
              <th class="fourth-column"></th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td class="ordinary-cell"></td>
              <td class="ordinary-cell"></td>
              <td class="ordinary-cell"></td>
              <td class="fourth-column">Future</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="ordinary-cell"></td>
              <td class="ordinary-cell"></td>
              <td class="ordinary-cell"></td>
              <td class="fourth-column">Present</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="ordinary-cell"></td>
              <td class="ordinary-cell"></td>
              <td class="ordinary-cell"></td>
              <td class="fourth-column">Past</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        
        <br>

        <p>Let's take a look at the positive statements first</p>
        <p>First we need some verbs, we'll start with these two:</p>
        <p class="new-words">
          love - querer<br>
          live - vivir
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's start with the present tense. When we make a positive statement we use this structure: [pronoun] + [verb].
          <br>
          Except for "He" and "She", with these pronouns we should add "s" at the end of a verb. So the structure will look like this: [pronoun] + [verb] + "s"
          <br><br>
          When we make a posotive statement but in the future we use the word "will" [pronoun] + "will" + [verb].
          <br><br>
          When we make a positive statement in the past we add "ed" to the end of the verb
        </p>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Question</th>
              <th>Positive</th>
              <th>Negative</th>

      </section>

      <section class="full-table">
        <p class="aligned-left margin-up">
          Let's go over full table now. I would recommend reading this and after each example looking at the table to see the examples
          <br><br>
          Let's take a look at the negative statements now. If we want to deny something in the present we need to use this structure: [pronoun] + "don't" + [verb], except for he and she where the structure is slightly different: [pronoun] + "doesn't" + [verb]
          <br><br>
          When we ask a question in the present tense we add "do" before the pronoun so the structure will look like this: do + [pronoun] + [verb]
          <br>
          Except for "He" and "She", with these we will use "does", and the structure will look like this: does + [pronoun] + [verb]
          <br><br>
          When we make negative statements in the future, all we need to do is to add "not" to "will", so the structure will look like this: [pronoun] + will + not + [verb]
          <br><br>
          When it comes to question in the future the structure is similar to the positive statement, we only need to flip the pronoun and "will", so the structure should look like this: will + [pronoun] + [verb]
          <br><br>
          When we make negative statements in the past we use "didn't": [pronoun] + didn't + [verb]
          <br><br>
          In order to ask a question in the past we take the word "did" and put it in front of the pronoun, so the structure looks like this: did + [pronoun] + [verb]
          <br><br>
          Finally i want to mention positive statement in the past once again, and cover one more thing related to it. From the example above we know that we add "ed" to the verb to turn it into its past from, that only works with regular verbs, but there are also irregular verbs. A lot of people find it confusing when it comes to irregular verbs, but i want to show you that they are nithying to worry about. the only time we would wanna use them is when we make a positive statement in the past. Let's take a super-duper irregular verb "see"(ver). We can use this verb just any other one in the table, it will follow all the rules that we just mentioned. Let's take a look at some examples below:
        </p>
        <p class="aligned-left example">
          I see - Yo veo <br>
          I don't see - Yo no veo<br>
          Do I see? - ¿Veo?<br>
          I will see - Veré<br>
          Will I see? - ¿Veré?<br>
          I will not see - No veré<br>
          I didn't see - No vi<br>
          Did I see? - ¿Vi?
        </p>
        <p class="aligned-left">
          And only in one case when it's a positive statement in the past we will have to use the second form of that verb "saw". So "i saw" translates to "yo vi". So, when we use regular verbs we add "ed" at the end, and when we use irregular verbs we use the second form, ONLY in this case. 
        </p>

        <p class="bigger">Great job getting this far! Take a break for a second and read this little piece below👇 It has some really cool insights!</p>
        <br><br>

        <p>
          What I'm about to share with you is never talked about but i think is really important to know and understand.
          <br><br>
          When you think of English it always helps to have something associated with it. It could be anything depending on the person. It could be a feeling, an emotion, a metal image, anything at all. 
          <br><br>
          Take a moment here and think of what comes to mind when you hear the word "English". Whatever comes to you will be your link to English world. A button if you will, pressing which would help you enter this universe. 
          <br><br>
          English is not just a bunch of grammar rules and words. It's also emotions, feelings, memories and so much more. I will talk about it in more detail in the future lessons, bur for now i want you to find this something that you associate with English and think of it anytime you need help to switch from your native channel to English channel.
          <br><br>
          The second point that i want to talk about is not to think in your native language when you speak English. It is important. When you speak your thoughts should also be in English. When you hear a word TV in your native language you don't translate it to any other one you just picture TV. You should try doing the same in English. When you hear TV you picture a TV set. When you hear the word "cat" you picture a cat, maybe you can even hear his meowing. When you hear "water" you can imagine how you drink it on a hot day, how it sounds when you hear it run in a river in the forest. When you say "i walk" you picture something dynamic, you picture yourself walking down the street or anywhere else but walking, and so on and so forth.
          <br><br>
          This stuff is usually not talked about, but it is really important for a more natural language acquisition. 
          <br><br>
          We will be coming back to this idea throughout the course to bring this point home.

        <p class="bigger">In the meantime let's learn some more irregular verbs and put all your skills to practice! From now on all the irregular verbs will come with their second form in parentheses. Remember: we use the second only in one case, when we use Past Positive</p>
        <p class="new-words">
          come (came) - venir<br>
          go (went) - ir<br>
          know (knew) - saber, conocer
        </p>

        <h2 class="centered">This concludes our first lesson!</h2>
        <p>
          I hope you learned a bunch today. Before you go i will ask you to do one thing. Go over the table that you have learned today, pick a verb and run it through the table, for now it's ok to look at the table as you do this. Do it once in the morning, once at lunchtime, once in the evening.
          <br><br>
          Our goal is to make this table work for us, so that in the future you wouldn't even need time to think which tense to use you would just do it automatically, without thinking about, simply enjoying the conversation and having a good time. Because at the end of the day enjoying the language is the most important thing. This freedom to say anything you want, without stress is what we're aiming for.
          <br><br>
          Moving forward we will be tackling more complex concepts, but everything will be built on top of what we're learning right now. You can't put a cherry on top of a cale with having made the actual cake. Layer by layer we will cover everything you need to know to become a great English Speaker.
