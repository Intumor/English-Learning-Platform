      <h1>Lesson 11</h1>
      <h2>Welcome to the eleventh lesson!</h2>
    </header>
    <main>
      <section id="section-one">
        <p>
          In this lesson we will cover some more ground in basics. We will learn a new very useful structure in English. So we have gone over basic verb structure, we have taken a look at the structure of the verb "to be". We have learned about he form that emphasizes thatb the action is happening at a certain moment. Now let's take a look at the structure that we will use when we're talking about some kind of result of an action. <br><br>
        </p>
        <div class="schoolboard">
          <div class="example-box">
            <p class="for-example">For regular verbs the structure is going to be like this: <br><br> [pronoun] + [to have] + [verb in the past, with "ed" ending]</p>
          </div>
          <p class="example">
            I have loved <br>
            She has talked <br>
            You have managed
          </p>
          <div class="example-box">
            <p class="for-example">For irregular verbs the structure is going to be like this: <br><br> [pronoun] + [to have] + [verb's third form]</p>
          </div>
          <p class="example">
            I have seen <br>
            She has spoken <br>
            You have gone
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          You already know about irregular verbs and that we use the second form for making a positive statement in the past. All irregular verbs have three forms though, and the third form is used in this case where we talk about some kind of results
        </p>
        <p>
          We have a similar structure in Spanish
        </p>
        <p class="example example-no-board">
          I see - Yo veo <br>
          I saw - Yo vi <br>
          I have seen - Yo he visto
        </p>
        <p>
          So when we talk about something that happened in the past and matters right now we use this structure. Let's take a look at some examples
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="new-words">see (saw) [seen] - ver</p>
        <p class="example example-no-board">
          "Do you want to watch "Spider-Man?" <br>
          "No, <span class="highlighted">i have seen</span> this movie already"
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          So here when the person says "i have seen it", it's not just a simple fact, that it happened, they're saying that thye already have the information about this movie, they know it, they know what they're talking about, they've already had this experience
        </p>
        <p class="example example-no-board">
          "<span class="highlighted">Have you</span> ever <span class="highlighted">loved</span>?"<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here a person is asking about an experience as well. one thing you might have noticed here is that "have" and the pronoun switched places to build a question. It's just a special feature of this tense. When it comes to asking qustion in this tense we just put "to have" before the pronoun
        </p>
        <p class="example example-no-board">
          "<span class="highlighted">Has he seen</span> you?"<br>
          "<span class="highlighted">Have you talked</span> to her?"<br>
        </p>
        <p class="new-words">make (made) [made] - hacer</p>
        <p class="example example-no-board">
          "Do you want to get a beer with me?"<br>
          "No, <span class="highlighted">i have</span> already <span class="highlighted">made</span> some plans"
        </p>
        <p>
          So here a person is talking about results of his actions. He made plans in the past but they matter right now, so the past affects the person's response, the present<br><br>
          When it comes to using the verb "to be" in that structure we will use the third form as well which is "been"
        </p>
        <p class="example example-no-board">
          <span class="highlighted">I have been</span> to Germany many times<br>
          <span class="highlighted">She has been</span> a doctor for 3 years
        </p>
        <p>
          Probably you've noticed that the verb "make" has the same exact second and third form. Some verbs are like that. For example the verb "cut" (cortar) is the same in all three forms - cut (cut) [cut]. You will eventually commit all of them to memory. There are not that many irregular verbs, however they are the most popular ones. <br><br>
          From now on, if the verb is irregular, you will see all three forms of it.
        </p>
        <p class="new-words">
          complete - completar <br>
          travel - viajar <br>
          see (saw) [seen] - ver <br>
          write (wrote) [written] - escribir <br>
          finish - terminar <br>
          eat (ate) [eaten] - comer <br>
          learn - aprender <br>
          change - cambiar <br>
          build (built) [built] - construir <br>
          lose (lost) [lost] - perdir <br>
        </p>
        <p>Let's get some pratice with this structure! It might not be entirely clear as to how to use them when you speak but don't worry. It's a new concept, give it a little bit of time, let it sink in, as you start exposing yourself to even more English, this concept will fall right into place</p>

      <section id="section-two">
        <h2>Feelings</h2>
        <div class="schoolboard">
          <div class="example-box">
            <p class="for-example">In Spanish we have one way to express feelings, in English there's a different one. In Spanish we say that we have a certain feeling or emotion, but in English you describe yourself using an adjective related to that emotion or feeling. </p>
          </div>
          <p class="example">
            I am afraid - Tengo miedo <br>
            I am hungry - Tengo hambre <br>
            I am cold - Tengo frío <br>
          </p>
          <div class="example-box">
            <p class="for-example">So when we say that in English we literally say: estoy hambriento, estoy frio <br><br> So that is the proper structure for describing emotions and feelings in English. Of course i should mention that in Spanish we can use a similar structure as in English, but in English it will be the same:</p>
          </div>
          <p class="example">
            I am tired - Estoy cansado <br>
            I am angry - Estoy enojado
          </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Let's practice!</h2>
        <p class="new-words">
          afraid - asustado <br>
          brave - valiente <br>
          happy - feliz <br>
          hungry - hambriento  <br>
          sad - triste <br>
          angry - enojado  <br>
          tired - cansado  <br>
          cold - frio <br>
          hot - caliente <br>
          bored - aburrido <br>
          interested - interesado
        </p>

      <section id="section-three">
        <h2>Weather</h2>
        <div class="schoolboard">
          <div class="example-box">
            <p class="for-example">When we talk about weather in English we use words that describe temperature or other phenomena and use this structure: It is ...</p>
          </div>
          <p class="example">
            it will be cold - va a hacer frío <br>
            it's hot - hace calor <br>
            it was dark - estaba oscuro
          </p>
          <div class="example-box">
            <p class="for-example">if we are talking about weather conditions the structure remains the same:</p>
          </div>
          <p class="example">
            it's raining - está lloviendo <br>
            it's snowing - está nevando <br>
            it's windy - hace viento
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section id="section-four">
        <p>
          You might have noticed that sometimes there is more than one way of saying something. I'm talking about using words "nothing" and "anything" in particular. Let's take a look at two sentences:
        </p>
        <p class="example example-no-board">
          I don't know anything <br>
          I know nothing
        </p>
        <p>
          These two sentences mean the exact same thing and look at the way words "nothing" and "anything" are being used. You can use any of these words you like when you build similar kind of sentences but make sure to use proper structure as above
        </p>
        <h4>
          Rewrite the following sentences with the words "nothing" and "anything" using the opposite word from the one that is being used in the sentence
        </h4>
