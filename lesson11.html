        <p>
          In this lesson we will cover some more ground in basics. We will learn a new very useful structure in English. So we have gone over basic verb structure, we have taken a look at the structure of the verb "to be". We have learned about he form that emphasizes thatb the action is happening at a certain moment. Now let's take a look at the structure that we will use when we're talking about some kind of result of an action. <br><br>
        </p>
        <div class="schoolboard">
          <div class="example-box">
            <p class="for-example">For regular verbs the structure is going to be like this: <br><br> [pronoun] + [to have] + [verb in the past, with "ed" ending]</p>
          </div>
          <p class="example">
            I have loved <br>
            She has talked <br>
            You have managed
          </p>
          <div class="example-box">
            <p class="for-example">For irregular verbs the structure is going to be like this: <br><br> [pronoun] + [to have] + [verb's third form]</p>
          </div>
          <p class="example">
            I have seen <br>
            She has spoken <br>
            You have gone
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          You already know about irregular verbs and that we use the second form for making a positive statement in the past. All irregular verbs have three forms though, and the third form is used in this case where we talk about some kind of results
        </p>
        <p>
          We have a similar structure in Spanish
        </p>
        <p class="example example-no-board">
          I see - Yo veo <br>
          I saw - Yo vi <br>
          I have seen - Yo he visto
        </p>
        <p>
          So when we talk about something that happened in the past and matters right now we use this structure. Let's take a look at some examples
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="new-words">see (saw) [seen] - ver</p>
        <p class="example example-no-board">
          "Do you want to watch "Spider-Man?" <br>
          "No, i have seen this movie already"
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          So here when the person says "i have seen it", it's not just a simple fact, that it happened, they're saying that thye already have the information about this movie, they know it, they know what they're talking about, they've already had this experience
        </p>
        <p class="example example-no-board">
          "Have you ever loved?"<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here a person is asking about an experience as well
        </p>
        <p class="new-words">make (made) [made] - hacer</p>
        <p class="example example-no-board">
          "Do you want to get a beer with me?"<br>
          "No, i have already made some plans"
        </p>
        <p>
          So here a person is talking about results of his actions. He made plans in the past but they matter right now, so the past affects the person's response, the present
