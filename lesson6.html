          In this lesson we will learn indiferent pronouns, and ways to say "cuando" in English, and also the difference between "how much" and "how many". But before all of that let's warm up with some speaking practice. Watch the video below to get an idea of what we're gonna be talking about.

            <li>What do you do when you have free time?</li>

        <h2>Expressing desires, intentions, or requests</h2>
        <div class="schoolboard">
          <p class="explanation">
            Let's spend some time on how to properly express desires, intentions and requests. When we want someone to do something for us we put it thus way in English: "i want you to learn" which translates to "quiero que aprendas". So the second proonoun the one that we talk about should always answer to the qestion "whom" - (me, you, us, them, him, her)
          </p>
          <div class="example-box">
            <p class="for-example">For example:</p>
            <p class="example">
              i want him to come - quiero que Ã©l venga<br>
              i need you to see this - necesito que veas esto<br>
              he wants us to go  - el quiere que vayamos<br>
              they want her to stay - ellos quieren que ella se quede
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="new-words">
          sing - cantar<br>
          want - querer <br>
          need - necesitar <br>
          jump - saltar <br>
          join - unirse <br>
          stop - parar <br>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="section-three">
        <h2>"How many" vs "How much"</h2>
        <div class="schoolboard">
          <div class="example-box">
            <p class="for-example">We use how "much" with something we can't count:</p>
            <p class="example">
              time, money, love, water
            </p>
          </div>
          <p class="explanation">Before you say "Oh, wait but i can count money!" i will say you can't. You can count dollars, pesos, euros, rupees, but we can't coun't money, it's something abstract</p>
          <div class="example-box">
            <p class="for-example">We use how "many" with something we can count:</p>
            <p class="example">
              days, hours, dollars, people
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section id="section-four">
        <h2>Other ways to say "Cuanto"</h2>
        <p>As you have probably noticed from the last exercise, in English we don't have the word "Cuanto", instead we use the word "how" coupled with another word related to what we are asking about. Here are some of them:</p>
        <ul class="example-list">
          <li>How long</li>
          <li>How often</li>
          <li>How far</li>
          <li>How fast</li>
          <li>How old</li>
          <li>How much</li>
          <li>How many</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          So if we want to ask someone how old they are we will say "How old are you?" which literally translates to "(spanish)". Or if we wanna ask how much time something will take we will say "How long will it take?", or if we want to ask how often something happens we wil also use this construction "How often do you come here?"
        </p>

        <h2>Other tricky adjectives</h2>
        <p>We have some other tricky words in English that could be confusing for Spanish speakers: "little" and "few", and "little" and "small", which could all be translated to Spanish as "poco", however we can't use them interchangably</p>
        <div class="schoolboard">
          <div class="example-box">
            <p class="for-example">When it comes to "little" vs "few", we use little with uncountables:</p>
            <p class="example">
              time, compassion, patience
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="example-box">
            <p class="for-example">And we use how "few" with countables:</p>
            <p class="example">
              people, cats, cars, animals
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="example-box">
            <p class="for-example">When it comes to "little" vs "small". We can also use little when we talk about someone's age, meaning they are young:</p>
            <p class="example">
              i saw two little girls playing outside
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="example-box">
            <p class="for-example">And we use how "small" when we refer to size:</p>
            <p class="example">
              These shoes are small
            </p>

          Great job! This one was difficult, so don't worry if you couldn't everything right. There were somethings that we haven't covered yet, but we will in the near future, for now just give your self some props for getting all the way here, you're making a lot of progress, and you should be proud of yourself. As you can see we are starting to build complex sentences, but everything is being built on the basic structures. So i will encourage you to keep finding a little bit of time, everyday, to go over them, as you can see their understanding is essential. Before you wrap up this lesson, i will have you take this last pop-quiz for today, to make sure you remember the infinitive from the previous lesson. Good luck and see you in the next one!
