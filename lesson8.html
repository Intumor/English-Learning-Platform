        <p>
          Before we get into practice i want to talk about one more thing. The difference between "in" and "at". When we say "i am in school" or anywhere else, "in the house", "in the car" and so on, we mean that we are inside of this thing. When we say "i am at school", "at work", "at home" we don't mean exactly being inside of those things, we mean being in the visinity of them. If i have a house and i have a garden on my property, even when i am in the garden i am still at home. I am not on the house but i am however at home. When i am at school, i could somewhere outside of the school building. I could be out at the quad, or school stadium, but if i get phone call asking me where i am i will still say "at school" and if i say "in the school" i would imply that i am in the school building. When i say "i am at the car" i mean that i am around the around, not literally inside of it, but somewhere near it.

        <h2>Phrasal verbs</h2>
        <p>
          In this section we will be taking a look at phrasal verbs. In English phrasal verbs are used all the time, whereas in Spanish we usually have a separate word for what you're trying to say, but in English you use the same verbs but the we add prepositions to them to change or augment their meaning. I think it's easier to see how it work with some examples
        </p>
        <p class="example example-no-board">
          I go - Yo voy <br>
          I go up - Subo<br>
          I go down - Bajo<br>
          I go back - Vuelvo<br>
          Go away - Vete<br>
          I go in - Entro<br>
          I go out - Salgo
        </p>
        <p class="example example-no-board">
          I look - Yo miro <br>
          I look up - Miro hacia arriba<br>
          I look down - Miro hacia abajo<br>
          I look back - Miro hacia atrás<br>
          Look away - Mira hacia otro lado<br>
          I look in - Miro adentro<br>
          I look out - Miro afuera <br>
          I look for - Busco
        </p>
        <p class="example example-no-board">
          I come - Yo vengo <br>
          I come up - Subo<br>
          I come down - Bajo<br>
          I come back - Vuelvo<br>
          I come in - Entro<br>
          I come out - Salgo <br>
        </p>
        <p class="example example-no-board">
          I take - Yo tomo <br>
          I take back - Me retracto<br>
          I take out - Yo saco <br>
          Take out the trash - Saca la basura <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          This, in a nutshell, is how the phrasal verbs work. Not all of the phrasal verbs are like that, sometimes the meaning is not obvious. For example: "Come up" generally means "ocurrirse", and a verb "Put up" means "toleraré"
        </p>
        <p class="example example-no-board">
          I came up with an idea - Se me ocurrió una idea<br>
          I don't have to put up with this - No tengo que aguantar esto<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't worry about those for now, but when you're gonna be with the language on your own you will have to look some of them up. One more verb that is worth mentionnig is "get" which roughly translates to "recibir", but it can have a lot of different meanings, especially when used as a phrasal verb. There is no point memoriing of all if its meanings, you will get familiar with it afterward, for now, i just want you to take it a look at it just so you have a cursory knowledge of it
        </p>
        <p class="example example-no-board">
          get up - Levantarse <br>
          get down - Bajar<br>
          get out - Marcharse <br>
          get in - Entrar<br>
          get away - Escapar <br>
          get back - Regresar
        </p>
        <p>
          So! Hopefully this gave you a chance to see what phrasal verbs are and how they work. With that out of the way let's jump right into the next section!
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="section-three">
        <h2>Look, See, and Watch</h2>
        <p>In this section we'll talk about the difference between verbs "look", "see" and "watch"</p>

        <p class="example-no-board margin-removed">See - Ver</p>

        <p>
          "See" is more about the natural act of perceiving things with your eyes without necessarily making a conscious effort to do so.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          "I can see the mountains from my window" - "Puedo ver las montañas desde mi ventana"
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          "See" can imply that something is within your field of vision or that you have the ability to perceive it visually.
        </p>

        <p class="example-no-board margin-removed">Look - Mirar</p>

        <p>
          "Look" is used when you intentionally direct your eyes towards something to observe it or to search for something specific.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          "Please look at that painting on the wall" - "Por favor, mira ese cuadro en la pared"
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          When you use "look," you are actively engaging your sense of sight to focus on something. Usually when we use look we use a preposition "at", as in the example above
        </p>
        <p class="example-no-board margin-removed">Watch - Observar</p>

        <p>
          "Watch" involves actively paying attention to something over a period of time, often involving movement or changes.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          "Let's watch the sunset" - "Vamos a observar el atardecer"
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          When you "watch" something, you are usually focusing your attention on it for a duration, such as watching a movie, a sports game, or a performance.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="section-four">
        <h2>"Listen" vs "Hear"</h2>
        <p class="example-no-board margin-removed">Hear - Oír</p>
        <p>
          When we use "hear" we usually mean the ability to hear, just like we mean the physycal ability to see when we use "see"
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          "I can't hear you, the volume is too low" - "No puedo oírte, el volumen está demasiado bajo"
        </p>
        <p class="example-no-board margin-removed">Listen - Escuchar</p>
        <p>
          When use "listen" we mean paying attention yo what you hear. Maybe someone is hearing you, but not listening to you. So if they "hear" you they can just physycaly hear that you're talking, but if they are "listening" to you, it means that they are paying attention to what you are saying 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          "You should always listen to your parents" - "Siempre debes escuchar a tus padres"
        </p>
        <br><br>

      <section id="section">
        <h2>How to be fluent in English</h2>
        <p>
          It's time to talk a little more about fluency. I mentioned some things at the beggining of this course, and in this section i want to go back to it, to make sure the ideas are still fresh in your mind.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          We slowly but surely start using more complex expressions sentences, but as you probably can see, we always inevitable come back to our basic structures that we have been learning all this time. This is the first point that i want to make sure you understand and remember. Going over the basics is the best favor you can't do yourself.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Second thing i wanted to talk about is the fluency mechanism itself. Some people even English teachers will tell you that vocabulary is the main factor when it comes to fluency, but it couldn't be further away from the truth. Take a five-year-old in your native language. They don't have a huge vocabulary, your vocabulary probably is lot richer, you can express yourself a lot more eloquently, accurately, but i'm not saying freely. becasue a fuve-year-old is pretty confident and liberal with the language. They don't struggle with words, they don't say "i don't how to say this in Spanish/English", they jsut find some words to say what they want to say. Sometimes it doesn't sound as good or accurate as the speech of an adult but they get the job done. This is the point. Even if you don't have a huge vocabulary, don't be afraid to speak, this is how we learn.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          At the beggining of this course i also asked you about an image you associated with English, remember? Did it change or is it still the same? When we use another language we should strive to be comfortable doing it, that's why i recommended you to think about something that you associate with English. You can use this image, emotion, feeling, whatever it is, to enter the world of English. It might seem unimportant and irrelevant, but i can garantee you that this goes a long way. This association will not only help you relax but also prime you for speaking or hearing English, it takes from Spanish realm into English, realm and it helps you break out from thinking in Spanish and switching to thinking in English. When we speak English we should do our best to alos think in English. This mechanism helps recreate learnign a language more intuitively like a child would. Maybe it won't be exactly the same but it will be the second best thing.
