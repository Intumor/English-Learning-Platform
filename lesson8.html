              Other prepositions are more abstract and are harder to find a picture for, so i will include them as they are:
            </p>
            <div>
              <p class="for-example">
                at - usually indicates a location or time
              </p>
              <p class="example">
                at 2 o'clock<br>
                at school <br>
                at work
              </p>

            <div>
              <p class="for-example">
                with - con
              </p>
              <p class="example">
                tea with sugar<br>
                i will play with you
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p class="for-example">
                without - sin
              </p>
              <p class="example">
                coffee without sugar<br>
                do you like your tea with or without sugar?
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p class="for-example">
                for - por, para
              </p>
              <p class="example">
                do it for me<br>
                will you buy it for me?
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p class="for-example">
                about - sobre
              </p>
              <p class="example">
                did you talk about me?<br>
                let's talk about it
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Before we get into practice i want to talk about one more thing. The difference between "in" and "at". When we say "i am in school" or anywhere else, "in the house", "in the car" and so on, we mean that we are inside of this thing. When we say "i am at school", "at work", "at home" we don't mean exactly being inside of those things, we mean being in the visinity of them. If i have a house and i have a garden on my property, even when i am in the garden i am still at home. I am not on the house but i am however at home. When i am at school, i could somewhere outside of the school building. I could be out at the quad, or school stadium, but if i get phone call asking me where i am i will still say "at school" and if i say "in the school" i would imply that i am in the school building. When i say "i am at the car" i mean that i am around the around, not literally inside of it, but somewhere near it.

        <h2>Phrasal verbs</h2>
        <p>
          In this section we will be taking a look at phrasal verbs. In English phrasal verbs are used all the time, whereas in Spanish we usually have a separate word for what you're trying to say, but in English you use the same verbs but the we add prepositions to them to change or augment their meaning. I think it's easier to see how it work with some examples
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Let's take a verb "go"</p>
        <br>
        <p class="example">
          I go - Yo voy <br>
          I go up - Subo<br>
          I go down - Bajo<br>
          I go back - Vuelvo<br>
          Go away - Vete<br>
          I go in - Entro<br>
          I go out - Salgo
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p class="example">
          I look - Yo miro <br>
          I look up - Miro hacia arriba<br>
          I look down - Miro hacia abajo<br>
          I look back - Miro hacia atrás<br>
          Look away - Mira hacia otro lado<br>
          I look in - Miro adentro<br>
          I look out - Miro afuera <br>
          I look for - Busco
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p class="example">
          I come - Yo vengo <br>
          I come up - Subo<br>
          I come down - Bajo<br>
          I come back - Vuelvo<br>
          I come in - Entro<br>
          I come out - Salgo <br>
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p class="example">
          I take - Yo tomo <br>
          I take back - Me retracto<br>
          I take out - Yo saco <br>
          Take out the trash - Saca la basura <br>
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
          This, in a nutshell, is how the phrasal verbs work. Not all of the phrasal verbs are like that, sometimes the meaning is not obvious. For example: "Come up" generally means "ocurrirse", and a verb "Put up" means "toleraré"
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p class="example">
          I came up with an idea - Se me ocurrió una idea<br>
          I don't have to put up with this - No tengo que aguantar esto<br>
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
          Don't worry about those for now, but when you're gonna be with the language on your own you will have to look some of them up. One more verb that is worth mentionnig is "get" which roughly translates to "recibir", but it can have a lot of different meanings, especially when used as a phrasal verb. There is no point memoriing of all if its meanings, you will get familiar with it afterward, for now, i just want you to take it a look at it just so you have a cursory knowledge of it
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="example">
          get up - Levantarse <br>
          get down - Bajar<br>
          get out - Marcharse <br>
          get in - Entrar<br>
          get away - Escapar <br>
          get back - Regresar
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
          So! Hopefully this gave you a chance to see what phrasal verbs are and how they work. With that out of the way let's jump right into the next section!
