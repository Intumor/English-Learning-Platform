      <h1>Lesson 9</h1>
      <h2>Welcome to our ninth lesson!</h2>

    <main>
      <section id="section-one">
        <p>
          In this lesson we will cover how to say "Hay" in English, "tener que", we'll learn about "reflexive pronouns", and we'll focus more on the speaking part. Let's get started!
        </p> 
        <h2 id="margin-top-5">"Hay" in English</h2>
        <div class="schoolboard">
          <div class="example-box">
            <p class="for-example">In order to say "Hay" in English, we need to establish if what we are talking about is singular or plural, if we are talking about just one thing we use "there is"</p>
          </div>
          <p class="example">
            There is a problem - Hay un problema <br>
            There is a car outside - Hay un coche afuera
          </p>
          <div class="example-box">
            <p class="for-example">When we are talking about multiple things we use "there are" which also translates to "hay"</p>
          </div>
          <p class="example">
            There are problems - Hay problemas <br>
            There are cars outside - Hay coches afuera
          </p>
          <div class="example-box">
            <p class="for-example">When we are talking about the past we wil also use one of the two versions depending on whether it is plural or singular. If it is simgular then we should use "there was"</p>
          </div>
          <p class="example">
            There was a problem - Hubo un problema <br>
            There was a car outside - Había un coche afuera
          </p>
          <div class="example-box">
            <p class="for-example">When we are talking about multiple things we use "there were"</p>
          </div>
          <p class="example">
            There were problems - Había problemas <br>
            There were cars outside - Había coches afuera
          </p>
          <div class="example-box">
            <p class="for-example">Finally when we use this structure in the Future we use "There will be" both for plural and singular</p>
          </div>
          <p class="example">
            There will be problems - Habrá problemas <br>
            There will be a car outside - Habrá un coche afuera
          </p>
          <div class="example-box">
            <p class="for-example">As you can see this structure is also build on the basic "to be" structure</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section id="section-two">
        <h2>Reflexive pronouns</h2>
        <div class="schoolboard">
          <div class="example-box">
            <p class="for-example">In this section we'll keep exploring pronouns. When we want to emphasize that we did something or will do something all by ourselves we would use these pronouns:</p>
          </div>
          <p class="example">
            Myself - Yo mismo <br>
            Yourself - Tu mismo <br>
            Ouselves - Nosotros mismos <br>
            Themselves - Ellos mismos <br>
            Himself - Él mismo <br>
            Herself - Ella mismo
          </p>
          <div class="example-box">
            <p class="for-example">Notice how in the words "Ourselves" and "Themselves" there is "ves" instead of "f". It's because these words are used in plural so they are pronounced in plural as well. The word "Yourself" can also be used in plural as "Yourselves" if you're refering to multiple people</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          The usage of these pronouns could be tricky though. Basically any time we have to say something like this: "I like me" or "John looks at John" we will need these kind of pronouns. Instead we will say "I like myself" and "John looks at himself". 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Istead of "Jane cooks for Jane" or "Jane cooks for her" we would use "Jane cooks for herself"
        </p>

        <h2>Filler words</h2>
        <p>
          In this next section we will learn about filler words. A lot of professional teachers might judge me for that but i think it is important to know and use fillers. It can be a very nice way to feel more relaxed when speaking it can buy some time if you need to think of a word you wanna use and also native speakers use it all the time! Which means so should you! Let's take a look at some of them
        </p>
        <div class="schoolboard">
          <div class="example-box">
            <p class="for-example">Like - probably the most popular filler word in English. It's used similarly to "este" in Spanish.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="example">
            I wanted to talk to you, but it was like... akward<br>
          </p>
          <div class="example-box">
            <p class="for-example">I mean - is used to emphasize or make clear a point you are making. It's similar to "o sea" in Spanish.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="example">
            I think we will go home. I mean, it's a great party, but we have work tomorrow<br>
          </p>
          <div class="example-box">
            <p class="for-example">You know - is used to fill in the pauses. It's similar to ¿sabes?" or "¿sabes qué?" in Spanish.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="example">
            I will go there next week, you know, to see what they have<br>
            I think we should talk. You know what i mean?
          </p>
          <div class="example-box">
            <p class="for-example">So - entonces</p>
          </div>
          <p class="example">
            So, i think i'll see you next week!<br>
          </p>
          <div class="example-box">
            <p class="for-example">Just - This one doesn't have a precise equivalent in Spanish, but it means something like "Solo", "solamente" or "Simplemente"</p>
          </div>
          <p class="example">
            I just want to talk!<br>
            I think we will just do it and then we will think about it
          </p>
        </div>
        <p class="last-par">
          These are just a few of course, but there are more of them. This will not be drilled, the point was to show you it exists and tell you that you shouldn't avoid them. Fillers are not inherenly bad and it's ok to use them Especially if you're a begginer, as it is a great way to relieve some stress and help you feel more comfortable speaking English
